# Analyzing Splitwise Data

## About this repository
This repository contains a Python script to analyze the exported data from [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/). 
The current functionality is to sum up all expenses registered to get a total expense in a desired currency as well as a pie chart with the Splitwise categories to show you what the money was spent on.

This can help to keep track on the money spent on a trip and what it was spent on, while not requiring a SplitwisePro account.
